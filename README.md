# Three.js Starter Template
This is just a basic Three.js starter template.

Recently I decided to switch this from Webpack to Vite, mostly because there was a security issue in one of the previous package dependencies.

So currently this repo is a copy of my Three.js PWA template.

At some point in the future I will hopefully update this starter template to include more of the components that I would commonly use in my Three.js projects such as enviroment images etc.
